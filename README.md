# SIM800-AVR
Setting up GSM module (SIM800) with AVR 
SIM800 is a GSM module which usually used for IOT purposes. It support serial port for hardware data transfering and also it support **"AT"** commands. Here AVR ATmega16 is used for
implementing a simple project for ***Send*** or ***Recieve*** data from the module. It can be a good project for practicing AVR microcontrollers programming. It use
